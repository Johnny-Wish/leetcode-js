# Solution to LeetCode problems (JavaScript)
This is an ongoing project that aims to solve all problems on LeetCode in JavaScript.
I plan on solving the problems by order of LeetCode index. Hopefully, I will find time to solve more than 3 problems every day.

See more on my LeetCode account page: [Johnny_Liu](https://leetcode.com/johnny_liu/).

## TODO list
- Problem 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
  - To implement Manacher's Algorithm which has O(n) complexity
- Problem 10. Regular Expression Matching
  - To implement parser, compiler, matcher based on DFA/NFA for general regex
